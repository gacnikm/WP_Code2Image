Wordpress plugin that creates images from blocks of code in posts to use as post thumbnail.
Supports only Enlighter's code blocks.
After post's status is set to publish, and the post has no thumbnail image set, 
all code blocks within it are sent to service Instaco.de which converts them to image; 
they are then stored as post's images in library.
